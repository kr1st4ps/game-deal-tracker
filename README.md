# Game deal tracker

This code will take a list of games you want (PS store games for now, Oculus store to be readded soon), and check the current price in the respective store every hour.
If and when the game is discounted or has a different full price than before, you will be notified via email.

To be able to properly use this:

-   Modify config.ini with your data where it is asked

-   Check requirements.txt, to make sure you have all necessary python libraries installed

-   When adding the name of your wanted game, please use exact full name from PS store
